## Description  
Given a set of integers, sort it using a predefined set of instructions using two stacks. The instruction set is defined below. This program outputs a program in push_swap instructions that sorts the input integers.

## Rules

For the following instructions, if the instruction is not possible, the part of
it that can't be executed won't.

| Code  | Instruction                         | Action                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sa`  | swap a                              | swaps the 2 top elements of stack a                    |
| `sb`  | swap b                              | swaps the 2 top elements of stack b                    |
| `ss`  | swap a + swap b                     | both `sa` and `sb`                                     |
| `pa`  | push a                              | moves the top element of stack b at the top of stack a |
| `pb`  | push b                              | moves the top element of stack a at the top of stack b |
| `ra`  | rotate a                            | shifts all elements of stack a from bottom to top      |
| `rb`  | rotate b                            | shifts all elements of stack b from bottom to top      |
| `rr`  | rotate a + rotate b                 | both `ra` and `rb`                                     |
| `rra` | reverse rotate a                    | shifts all elements of stack a from top to bottom      |
| `rrb` | reverse rotate b                    | shifts all elements of stack b from top to bottom      |
| `rrr` | reverse rotate a + reverse rotate b | both `rra` and `rrb`                                   |

You can run it with:
```sh
  $> ./push_swap <list_of_numbers>
```

## Makefile rules

| Rule         |                 Description                             |
|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
| `make`       | Compile the program.                                    |
| `make clean` | Remove every objects of compilation                     |
| `make fclean`| Do `clean` rule and remove the executable program       |
| `make re`    | Do `fclean` rule and compile the program mandatory      |
